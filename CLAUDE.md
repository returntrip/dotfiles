## Workflow notes

- Chezmoi dotfiles repo. The source tree is under `home/`; `home/.chezmoi.toml.tmpl` is the config template that computes machine flags (`isLinux`, `isWSL`, `isMacOS`, `isBlueX`, `isTTY`, `machineClass`, `work`/`personal`).
- After changing the config template, the target machine must run `chezmoi init` to regenerate its config — chezmoi does not auto-re-render a changed config template, it warns "run chezmoi init to regenerate config file". Then `chezmoi apply`.
- Machine classification lives in `home/.chezmoidata/machines.yaml` (hostname → work/personal). Unknown hostnames prompt once at init.
- Git push is done by the user via Zed from the host. Never set sandbox-https as the default upstream.

## TODO

- **macOS shell**: decided — macOS uses zsh with `dot_zshrc.tmpl` (cross-shell bits: aliases, addalias, EDITOR, atuin, mise, starship, secretsload). bash-only files (`.bashrc`, `.bash_aliases`, `.bash_profile`, `.inputrc`, blesh) stay excluded from macOS. Near term: verify the zshrc on a real Mac. Longer term: port the Linux side (`.bashrc` + `.bash_aliases`) to zsh so it's zsh everywhere — `shell-common` is already shared and mostly shell-agnostic, easing that port; then fold it into a single `zshrc` and drop the bash files. Chose zsh over fish (non-POSIX).
- **nono**: work-machine variants needed. Currently excluded from the work profile entirely.
## Template safety rule (empty-render hazard)

A template that can render empty on some profile will **overwrite an existing
target with an empty file** on that profile (this zeroed `~/.ssh/config` on
macOS: `dot_ssh/config.tmpl` renders only when `.isWSL`). Any template whose
literal output is entirely inside an `if`-gate **must** either:

- be ignored on the profiles where it would render empty (`.chezmoiignore`), or
- render a non-empty safe default on those profiles.

Before adding or editing a template, check it cannot render empty on any
machine class. `chezmoi apply --dry-run --verbose` shows what each profile
would write.
